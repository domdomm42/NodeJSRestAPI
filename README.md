# NODEJS Rest API

# Goal
I wanted to see how REST APIs work under the hood using node.js without any frameworks(like express).

# Conclusion
An even greater appreciation not to just node frameworks but to every sort of framework. It is clear how frameworks impact the quality and speed of code production.
